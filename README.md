This is a Boggle game created using Javascript, jQuery, and CSS for the front end. And Flask, Python for the back end. 


## Overview

Users should be able to:

- See the game board and type words into the input form.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- jQuery
- Javascript
- Flask
- Python


### What I learned

I learned to make use of Front End and Back End technologies and make them work together. Using Javascript to manipulate the DOM, and Python to creates routes in Flask. I also used the python unit test to test functions and make sure they work, and requests were going where they were supposed to.

### Continued development
